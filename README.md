## Song Recommendations
User can input text about their life (how their day is going, etc..), which reveals their current emotions analyzed by [IBM Watson Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/). 

To narrow down the number of search results returned from Spotify Web API, 1-5 music genres have to be specified by the user.
